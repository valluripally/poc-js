To learn :
1. diff b/w for and forEach
2. String functions



Javascript 

1.Variables - to store value of different data types.
2. var x = undefined means that we have nothing inside the variable x

var Person={
name:"sai",
age:"20"
};
3. Object.values(Person) == sai,20 , we can get all values by using Object.values
4.When we have nested objects Object.values will give us [object object] for the inner object.


       arrays
	   
5. arrays allow u to store multiple values , we can have same or different data types in array but best practice to have them of same type.
6.  names=["sai","deep"] names.length -- gives size of the array = 2
7.  for( var n of names){
log(n);
}
sai
deep
8.names.foreach(function(n,index){
log(n+index)
})
                   Functions
   
9. Function is a procedure which is set of statements  that allows u to perform a task
                   
				   
				   Loops
				   
10.				   differnce b/w break, continue is 
				   var n=0;
				   
				   while(n>5){                      
				  log(n)
				   if(n==2)         0,1,2,
				   {break;}
				   n=n+1;
				    
				   }  --- breaks loops entirelty
				   
				   while(n>5){     0,1,3,4
				   
				    n=n+1;
				   if(n==2)
				   {continue;}
				  log(n)
				   }  --- continue skips that iteration and moves to next iteration
				   
				   Comparison and Logical operators
				   
11.  == compares 2 variables but ignores data type(log(10=='10') will be true this conversion of one data type to other is called coersion.
      wheras 10==='10' will be false

12.  typeof (0)  returns data type

13. semicolan is not mandatory but good to be consistent.  Generally , eslint is used to find problems in js 
14. we can use single or double quotes there is no diff here in js.
15.
