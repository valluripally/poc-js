To learn :
1. diff b/w for and forEach
2. String functions



Javascript 

1.Variables - to store value of different data types.
2. var x = undefined means that we have nothing inside the variable x

var Person={
name:"sai",
age:"20"
};
3. Object.values(Person) == sai,20 , we can get all values by using Object.values
4.When we have nested objects Object.values will give us [object object] for the inner object.


       arrays
	   
5. arrays allow u to store multiple values , we can have same or different data types in array but best practice to have them of same type.
6.  names=["sai","deep"] names.length -- gives size of the array = 2
7.  for( var n of names){
log(n);
}
sai
deep
8.names.foreach(function(n,index){
log(n+index)
})
                   Functions
   
9. Function is a procedure which is set of statements  that allows u to perform a task
                   
				   
				   Loops
				   
10.				   differnce b/w break, continue is 
				   var n=0;
				   
				   while(n>5){                      
				  log(n)
				   if(n==2)         0,1,2,
				   {break;}
				   n=n+1;
				    
				   }  --- breaks loops entirelty
				   
				   while(n>5){     0,1,3,4
				   
				    n=n+1;
				   if(n==2)
				   {continue;}
				  log(n)
				   }  --- continue skips that iteration and moves to next iteration
				   
				   Comparison and Logical operators
				   
11.  == compares 2 variables but ignores data type(log(10=='10') will be true this conversion of one data type to other is called coersion.
      wheras 10==='10' will be false

12.  typeof (0)  returns data type

13. semicolan is not mandatory but good to be consistent.  Generally , eslint is used to find problems in js 
14. we can use single or double quotes there is no diff here in js.
                  Map - Filter -Reduce 
				  
15.            [1,2,3,4,5].map(function(n){
            return n*2;
                      })	   the function is performed on each item of array .Basically to transform we use map. In map inside function we can return anything since it is for transformation.
					  
16.       [1,2,3,4,5].filter(function(n){
            return n%2==0;
                      })     	the function is performed on each item of array but filter always should return only boolean and only true values are printed 		

17. reduce allows us to accumulate all values of array and redu e to single value.

                       Callback

function outerFunction(name,callback)    {
    log(callback(name))
}   

var callback= function  (name){
    return "hello" +name;


}
outerFunction("sai",callback);		

outer function return inner function and inner function makes use of the other param in the outerFunction.
